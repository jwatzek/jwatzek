### Hey there, I'm Julia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist who is driven to make sense of why people do what they do and to figure out how we can make better decisions. I earned my PhD in psychology / cognitive sciences studying why, when, and how humans and other primates make irrational decisions. Currently, I work on search and discovery at Audible to empower listeners to find content that they'll love.
